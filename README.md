## What Makes Me Different in EdTech

**Most EdTech developers** build platforms but never use them to teach.  
**Most educators** understand learning but can't build the technical solutions.  
**I do both** - and bring network engineering reliability thinking to educational technology.

### My EdTech Advantage:
- **User Experience Reality**: I see what actually works (and breaks) in real classrooms
- **Network Engineering Mindset**: I build platforms that work reliably in challenging conditions
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: I can handle everything from database optimization to user interface design
- **Teaching Communication Skills**: I can explain technical concepts to both developers and educators

## About Me

I'm an **EdTech Full-Stack Developer** currently building and maintaining learning management systems while teaching **coding and robotics** to students from remote backgrounds. I bring **CCNA** and **CompTIA Security+** network engineering experience to educational platform development.

**What makes me unique?** I don't just build learning platforms - I use them daily to teach real students. This gives me insights into what actually works in education technology, not just what looks good in demos.

**Current focus:** Developing robust, scalable learning platforms that work reliably even in challenging network conditions - because education can't afford downtime.
